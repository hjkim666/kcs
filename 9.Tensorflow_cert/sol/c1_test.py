# There are 5 questions in this test with increasing difficulty from 1-5
# Please note that the weight of the grade for the question is relative

# Getting Started Question
#
# Given this data, train a neural network to match the xs to the ys
# So that a predictor for a new value of X will give a float value
# very close to the desired answer
# i.e. print(model.predict([10.0])) would give a satisfactory result
# The test infrastructure expects a trained model that accepts
# an input shape of [1]
